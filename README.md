## Intro

Have you ever wondered how to make those floating windows used by Facebook Heads and other apps? Have you ever wanted to use the same technology in your app? It’s easy, and I will guide you through the whole process.

I received feedback from tens of thousands of users and see various issues on different phones with different Android versions.

Here's what I learned along the way.
